----------------

This extension provides a global, simple abbreviation management based on extbase.

**Simple Abbreviation Management**

Abbreviaton Records are created at a central storage. They are localizable, and can also be created only for a specific language.

**Auto Detecting Feature**

Abbreviations entered in text content are detected automatically, and will be replaced with an <abbr> tag and the according term.

**Consistent and up to date**

A scheduled task can be created to keep all abbreviations consistent and up to date.
